# [ReactJS.NET](http://reactjs.net/)

ReactJS.NET is a library that makes it easier to use [Babel](http://babeljs.io/) along with Facebook's [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) and [JSX](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/jsx-in-depth.html) from C#.

# Features

- On-the-fly [JSX to JavaScript compilation](http://reactjs.net/getting-started/usage.html) via [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)

* JSX to JavaScript compilation via popular minification/combination
  libraries:
  - [ASP.NET Bundling and Minification](http://reactjs.net/bundling/weboptimizer.html)
  - [Cassette](http://reactjs.net/bundling/cassette.html)
  - [Webpack](http://reactjs.net/bundling/webpack.html)
  - [MSBuild](http://reactjs.net/bundling/msbuild.html)
* [Server-side component rendering](http://reactjs.net/features/server-side-rendering.html)
  to make your initial render super-fast, including support for:
  - [CSS-in-JS libraries](https://reactjs.net/features/css-in-js.html)
  - [React Router](https://reactjs.net/features/react-router.html)
  - [React Helmet](https://reactjs.net/features/react-helmet.html)

## Building Manually and Contributing

When building your own copy of ReactJS.NET (for example, if implementing a new
feature or fixing a bug), your first build always needs to be done using the
build script (`dev-build.bat`) as this generates a few files required by the
build (such as `SharedAssemblyVersionInfo.cs`). Once this build is completed,
you can open `React.sln` in Visual Studio and compile directly from Visual
Studio. Please refer to the [documentation page on
contributing](http://reactjs.net/dev/contributing.html) for more information on
contributing to ReactJS.NET.

Note that the build requires you to have Git installed. If you do not want to
install Git, you may remove the `GitVersion` task from `build.proj`.
