I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.1.3!

In this release, the React version has been upgraded from 0.11.1 to 0.12. The main changes in this React release are that `/** @jsx React.DOM */` is no longer required at the top of your JSX files, and `React.renderComponent` is now `React.render`. A few other API methods have changed as well. [See the official announcement](http://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/10/28/react-v0.12.html) for more information on all the changes in this version of React.

ReactJS.NET 1.1.3 also adds preliminary support for using Google's V8 JavaScript engine on Windows, via Microsoft's [ClearScript](https://clearscript.codeplex.com/) project. Previously ReactJS.NET only supported V8 on Mac OS X and Linux. This should be considered beta quality, in that it works but has not been stress tested in a production environment yet (whereas the Linux implementation has been). Future releases will make the handling of JavaScript engines more efficient.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
