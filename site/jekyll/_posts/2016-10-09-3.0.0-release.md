I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 3.0! The major change in this release is the addition of support for .NET Core!  [The tutorial](/tutorials/aspnetcore.html) has also been totally revamped for ASP.NET Core, and a completed version of the tutorial code is now [available in the ReactJS.NET Git repository](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/tree/master/tutorial-code)

**Major Changes**:

* Support for ASP.NET MVC 3 was removed. MVC 4 was released in 2012, so I hope everyone has upgraded by now :)
* [#294](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/294) - Added support for .NET Core
* [#306](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/306) - Upgraded to JavaScriptEngineSwitcher 2.0
* [#330](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/330) - Use camelcase for JSON by default. This corresponds with a [breaking change made in the final release of ASP.NET Core 1.0](https://github.com/aspnet/Announcements/issues/194). If you were relying on the legacy behaviour, you can use `SetJsonSerializerSettings` in your ReactJS.NET config to revert back to the old behaviour.

Other tweaks:

* [#323](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/323) - Upgraded to React 15.3.2
* [#331](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/331) - Added option to totally disable server-side rendering. This is useful when debugging your React components, as it's easier to debug client-side
* [#316](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/316) - Added option to use production version of React, and enabled it by default. You can call `SetUseDebugReact(true)` in your ReactJS.NET config to use the debug version. The production version of React is much faster than the debug build, but it has less useful error messages if something does go wrong.
* [#299](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/299) - Use file hash to check for file changes before transpiling. *Thanks to [Torben Rahbek Koch](https://github.com/TorbenRahbekKoch)*
* [#317](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/317) - Switched to [Paul Knopf](https://github.com/pauldotknopf)'s branch of VroomJs (V8 for Linux / Mac OS) rather than maintaining our own fork


Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
