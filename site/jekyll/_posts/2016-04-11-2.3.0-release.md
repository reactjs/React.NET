I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 2.3. This is a minor release, with most of the updates being updates to third-party components:

 - [#252](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/252) - Update to React 15
 - [#248](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/248) - Update `babel-standalone` to a version that bundles the `transform-decorators-legacy` plugin
 - [#251](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/251) - Upgrade to JSPool 0.4.1. Includes some fixes for high-concurrency environments
 - Upgrade to JavaScriptEngineSwitcher 1.5.2
 - Upgrade to ASP.NET RC1 Update 1
 - [#230](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/230) - Use GUIDs for container IDs, rather than sequential IDs

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
