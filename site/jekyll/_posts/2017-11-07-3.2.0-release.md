I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 3.2! This is a minor release with a few changes:

 - [#445](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/445) - Upgrade to React 16. *Thanks to [Dustin Masters](https://github.com/dustinsoftware)*.
 - [#407](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/407) and [#461](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/461) - Added support for React Router. *Thanks to [Gunnar Már Óttarsson](https://github.com/gunnim)*.
 - Renamed `React.Sample.Mvc6` to `React.Sample.CoreMvc`.
 - [#454](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/454) - Removed link to non-existent `byo-react` page. *Thanks to [Josh Goldberg](http://www.joshuakgoldberg.com)*.

Along with a few small changes for people compiling ReactJS.NET itself:
 - [#457](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/457) - Community, Enterprise, or Professional VS 2017 versions. Previously, it was only looking for the Community version. *Thanks to [Josh Goldberg](http://www.joshuakgoldberg.com)*.
 - [#450](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/450) - Upgraded MSBuildTasks from 1.4.0.65 to 1.5.0.235 so that ReactJS.NET can be built on systems that don't have .NET Framework 3.5 installed.
 - [#442](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/442) - Explicitly exclude `node_modules` from build to avoid a long-standing MSBuild bug.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
