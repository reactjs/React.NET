We're pleased to announce that ReactJS.NET 4.1.1 is now available for download.

-   Updated bundled version of React to 16.8.4, which brings support for hooks
-   Updated babel to 6.26.3. We're working on enabling opt-in support for Babel 7 as well, but if you need this today, please use the webpack integration.
-   Updated the [ASP.NET](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/tree/master/src/React.Web.Mvc4) and [.NET Core](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/tree/master/src/React.Sample.Webpack.CoreMvc) samples to demonstrate integrating third party libraries, such as Reactstrap.

We'd like to hear from you! If there are things you'd like to see added, please send feedback via [Github Issues](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues). We're a limited team and may not be able to implement what you'd like to see, but still want to hear how this project is being used and where it could be improved.

Cheers!
