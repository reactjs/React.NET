I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.1.2! This is a minor release and includes a number of changes and fixes since version 1.1.1:

 * Error messages now contain more details, including file name, component name, line number and column number. This should make debugging a bit easier, especially if you're debugging without Visual Studio attached. ([#17](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/17))
 * [JSX Namespacing](https://reactjs.org/blog/2014/07/17/react-v0.11.html#jsx-namespacing) is now supported ([#37](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/37))

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).

â€” Daniel
