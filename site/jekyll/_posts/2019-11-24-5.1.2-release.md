ðŸš€ We're pleased to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 5.1.2. A few small updates in this release:

- .NET Core 3.0 support. The [tutorial project](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/tree/master/src/React.Template/reactnet-vanilla) has also been updated to demonstrate the (simple!) migration path.
- React and ReactDOM updated to 16.12.0
- Fix missing query parameter mapping for React.Router - thanks [@mattywong](https://github.com/mattywong)

Please report any bugs in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues).

Cheers!
