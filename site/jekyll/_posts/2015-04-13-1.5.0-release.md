I'm happy to announce the release of ReactJS.NET 1.5! This is a minor release and includes a number of changes and fixes since version 1.4:

 * [#93](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/93) - Upgraded React to 0.13.1. See the full [changelog on the React site](https://reactjs.org/blog/2015/03/10/react-v0.13.html).
 * [#91](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/91) - Method to load a script without transforming it. It's becoming more and more common to use external build systems (Gulp, Grunt) or bundlers (Webpack, Browserify) that handle the JSX transformation. The output of these can be loaded directly into ReactJS.NET as it's just vanilla JavaScript. `AddScriptWithoutTransform` makes loading these files more efficient by just loading them directly.
 * New option to disable the MSIE JavaScript engine and force use of the V8 engine. If V8 can't be initialised for whatever reason, an exception is thrown.
 * [#103](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/pull/103) - Flag for `RenderHtml` to skip server-side rendering and only render the client-side JavaScript. Useful for debugging the JavaScript in a browser. *Thanks [Justin Slattery](https://github.com/jslatts)*.
 * [#60](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/60) - Scripts can now be loaded using wildcard patterns: `.AddScript("~/Content/*.js")`.
 * [#113](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/113) - Ability to provide your own React version rather than using the bundled version.
 * [#104](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET/issues/104) - Correctly handle exceptions in `ExecuteWithLargerStackIfRequired`, and upgrade to latest Newtonsoft.Json to fix issue with MSBuild.
 * Upgraded to JSPool 0.3 for better handling of recycling the JavaScript engines when a file changes.
 * Created missing React.Owin NuGet package.

Have fun, and as always, please feel free to send feedback or bug reports
[on GitHub](https://github.com/reactjs/React.NET).
