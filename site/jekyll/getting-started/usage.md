Once installed, create your React components as usual.

```javascript
// /Scripts/HelloWorld.jsx
const HelloWorld = (props) => {
  return (<div>Hello {props.name}</div>);
};
```

On-the-fly JSX to JavaScript Compilation
----------------------------------------
Hit a JSX file in your browser (eg. `/Scripts/HelloWorld.jsx`) and observe
the magnificence of JSX being compiled into JavaScript with no precompilation
necessary.

Next Steps
-----------
On-the-fly JSX compilation is good for fast iteration during development, but
for production you will want to precompile for best performance. This can be
done via [ASP.NET Bundling and Minification](/guides/weboptimizer.html) or
[Cassette](/guides/cassette.html).
